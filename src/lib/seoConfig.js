export const FAQ_GENERAL = [
  { q: "How much does an epoxy garage floor cost?", a: "An epoxy garage floor typically costs $4 to $12 per square foot installed, or about $2,400 to $7,200 for a standard 2-car garage (roughly 440 sq ft), depending on the system and floor condition." },
  { q: "How long does an epoxy garage floor last?", a: "A professionally installed epoxy garage floor lasts 10 to 20 years. Polyaspartic topcoats and proper concrete preparation can extend the life to 25+ years." },
  { q: "How long does garage floor installation take?", a: "Most residential garage floor coatings are completed in 1 to 2 days, with full cure in 24 to 72 hours depending on the system and temperature." },
  { q: "Do I need to prepare the concrete before coating?", a: "Yes. Mechanical grinding, crack repair, and moisture testing are required. Proper preparation is the single biggest factor in how long the coating lasts." },
  { q: "What is the difference between flake and metallic epoxy?", a: "Flake epoxy broadcasts colored vinyl flakes for a textured, speckled finish. Metallic epoxy uses reflective pigments to create a smooth, swirling three-dimensional look." },
  { q: "Is an epoxy garage floor slippery?", a: "Epoxy can be slippery when wet. Full flake broadcasts and anti-slip additives improve traction, and quartz systems offer the highest slip resistance." },
  { q: "Can you epoxy over an existing coating?", a: "Existing coatings must be removed or mechanically profiled first. Coating over failed epoxy will not bond and will peel." },
  { q: "What warranty comes with the installation?", a: "Xtreme Polishing Systems installations include a manufacturer-backed warranty. Your specialist provides the specific terms for your system." },
];

export const FAQ_COST = [
  { q: "How much does a 2-car garage epoxy floor cost?", a: "A 2-car garage epoxy floor (about 440 sq ft) costs $2,400 to $4,400 with a flake system, and $3,700 to $5,300 with a premium metallic finish." },
  { q: "How much does a 3-car garage epoxy floor cost?", a: "A 3-car garage epoxy floor (about 660 sq ft) costs $3,600 to $6,600 depending on the system and the concrete condition." },
  { q: "What is the price per square foot for epoxy garage floors?", a: "Epoxy garage floors cost $4 to $12 per square foot installed. Solid color is the lowest, flake is mid-range, and metallic and quartz systems are the highest." },
  { q: "What increases the cost of a garage floor coating?", a: "Crack repair, existing coating removal, moisture mitigation, custom colors, and larger square footage all increase the cost." },
  { q: "Is there a minimum project price?", a: "Yes. Most professional installers have a minimum project price of about $1,800 to cover setup, travel, and materials." },
];

export const FAQ_HOWITWORKS = [
  { q: "How does the estimate process work?", a: "Enter your property address, choose your floor condition and color, optionally add photos, and we look up your garage's square footage from public property records to build a personalized price range in about 60 seconds." },
  { q: "Do I have to commit to get an estimate?", a: "No. The estimate is free and there is no obligation. A specialist follows up only if you choose to proceed." },
  { q: "What happens after I receive my estimate?", a: "A specialist from Xtreme Polishing Systems contacts you within 24 hours to confirm your details, answer questions, and schedule your installation." },
